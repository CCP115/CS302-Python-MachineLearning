This repo contains our code for COMPSYS 302 Project 1.

COMPSYS302 is a paper based on Software Design. This project involved creating four neural networks using Python, PyTorch, and PyCharm.
These four networks were created by us, as well as trained and tested by us.

Packages used include scikit-learn and scikit-image, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, and PyTorch. Also included use of anaconda for managing virtual environments.



main.py contains the main executable code.

The utils folder contains many helper functions used to handle user input, create a dataloader, among other things.

The models folder contains all models used in our code.

The data folder contains csv files with MNIST style image data for both training and testing.
